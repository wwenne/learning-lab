Trading strategy

Momentum strategy
Momentum strategy is based on a theory that movement of a quantity will continue in its current direction. Thus, stocks have momentum, or upward or downward trends, and you can detect and exploit those trends. A moving average crossover and a dual moving average crossover are examples of the momentum strategy.
Mean-Aversion Strategy
Mean-aversion strategy means a tendency of asset prices to return to a trend path. Mean-reversion strategies are based on the opposite belief to momentum strategiesâ€”that is, if a financial instrument has performed too well relative to its trend, it is shorted, and vice versa. While time-series momentum strategies expect a positive correlation between returns, mean-reversion strategies anticipate a negative correlation.
