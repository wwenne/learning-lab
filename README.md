#### Mean-Aversion Strategy

#### Momentum Strategy

Mean-aversion strategy means a tendency of asset prices to return to a trend path. Mean-reversion strategies are based on the opposite belief to momentum strategiesâ€”that is, if a financial instrument has performed too well relative to its trend, it is shorted, and vice versa. While time-series momentum strategies expect a positive correlation between returns, mean-reversion strategies anticipate a negative correlation.
