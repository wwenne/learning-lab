## Asset pricing

#### Efficient Frontier

Efficient frontier is reffered to as "efficient" if it has best possible expected level of return for its level of risk. We can solve the minimisation problem by minimising risk for given mean return and top half minimum-variance frontier is known as efficient frontier, consisting of portfolios with hightest mean return for given amount of risk.

#### CAPM Model

CAPM model is a model used to determine a theoretically appropraite required rate of return of an asset, to make decisions about adding assets to a well-diversified portfolio. CAPM shows that the cost of equity capital is determined only by beta.

#### Performance Measurement

`Sharpe Ratio`is risk premium per unit of standard devistion. Its denominator is designed to capture total risk. And it is only appropriate for comparing performance of individual investment to well-diversified portfolio.

`Trenyor Ratio` is risk premium per unit of market risk. Its denominator is designed to capture systematic risk and ignore idiosyncratic risk. It can be used to compare performance of individual investment to both well-diversified and non-diversified portfolio.

`Sortino Ratio` is expected deviation from target return, per unit of below-target semi-deviation.

`Jensen's Alpha` is the intercept coefficient from market model regression using excess returns.

`Three Factor Alpha` -- use a linear regression model to determine exposure to market risk, size risk, and value risk for any asset. And the model fully explains stock returns, the estimated alpha should be statistically indistinguishable from zero.

### Trading Strategy

#### Momentum Strategy

Momentum strategy is based on a theory that movement of a quantity will continue in its current direction. Thus, stocks have momentum, or upward or downward trends, and you can detect and exploit those trends. A moving average crossover and a dual moving average crossover are examples of the momentum strategy.

#### Mean-Aversion Strategy

Mean-aversion strategy means a tendency of asset prices to return to a trend path. Mean-reversion strategies are based on the opposite belief to momentum strategiesâ€”that is, if a financial instrument has performed too well relative to its trend, it is shorted, and vice versa. While time-series momentum strategies expect a positive correlation between returns, mean-reversion strategies anticipate a negative correlation.
